most of the code was developed on debian (woody+sid?) using java and a bit of c 
and csound. this was about fourteen years ago now, so i don't remember versions 
or dependencies. i do remember hating java's guts most of the time, so oe3 is 
pure python poetry ;-)

some of the programs output midi files, some of which were edited using 
propellerhead's reason, and then mixed using protools.
