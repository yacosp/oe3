0. install DEPENDENCIES

1. if starting from a clean state: create at least one estim, ie:
   `bin/coag_add_ice src/estim/oneras/*.jpg`

2. run `bin/logtails -f var/log/oe3.log` on one term.

3. run `bin/oe3` on a second term.

4. check the log, wait, listen, reward generously.

5. send me an email to yaco@yaco.net. yes, this is required ;)

6. explore options, read code, mess with it. have fun, keep sending emails!


as an alternative to the three first steps, you can run bin/voe4t from a term
emulator, which will open a tmux session with a viewer and logtail. you can
execute comands from the shell at the top left pane.
